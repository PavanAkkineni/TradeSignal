## 🚀 Quick Start: Single Company Pipeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

**Data to Fetch**:
```
✓ Daily Adjusted (2 years) - Primary technical data
✓ Company Overview - Context
✓ Income Statement (5 years) - Growth and profitability
✓ Balance Sheet (5 years) - Financial health
✓ Cash Flow (5 years) - Earnings quality
```

**Why Start Here**:
- These 5 data types provide 80% of signal value
- Can generate basic buy/sell/hold signals
- Foundation for more advanced analysis

**Implementation**:
1. Create `Daily/` folder, fetch daily adjusted data
2. Create `Fundamental/` folder, fetch financial statements
3. Store data locally with timestamps
4. Calculate basic technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD)
5. Calculate fundamental ratios (P/E, ROE, Debt/Equity)

---

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Week 2)

**Additional Data**:
```
✓ News & Sentiments (90 days) - Catalysts and risks
✓ Insider Transactions (12 months) - Smart money
✓ Earnings Estimates - Forward expectations
✓ Earnings History (8 quarters) - Track record
```

**Why Add These**:
- News identifies upcoming catalysts
- Insiders provide non-public confidence signals
- Estimates show where stock is headed

**Implementation**:
1. Create `Sentiment/` folder
2. Implement sentiment scoring algorithm
3. Create `Alternative/` folder for insider data
4. Build alert system for unusual insider activity

---

### Phase 3: Advanced (Week 3-4)

**Optional Data**:
```
✓ Intraday 5min (30 days) - If day trading
✓ Weekly Adjusted (3 years) - Medium-term trends
✓ Earnings Call Transcripts (8 quarters) - Management insight
✓ Options Data - Volatility and sentiment
```

**Implementation**:
1. Multi-timeframe analysis (daily + weekly alignment)
2. FinLLM integration for transcript analysis
3. Options-based volatility metrics

## 📈 Signal Generation Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: Data Collection**
```
For each symbol (e.g., IBM):
  ↓
Fetch TIER 1 data (Daily + Fundamentals)
  ↓
Fetch TIER 2 data (Sentiment + Insider)
  ↓
Fetch TIER 3 data (Intraday if day trading)
  ↓
Store in organized folders
```

**STEP 2: Individual Signal Calculation**
```
Technical Analysis:
  ↓
Calculate indicators (RSI, MACD, MA)
  ↓
Generate technical signal (-100 to +100)
  ↓
Assign confidence based on indicator agreement
  
---

Fundamental Analysis:
  ↓
Calculate ratios (P/E, ROE, Debt/Equity, etc.)
  ↓
Generate fundamental signal (-100 to +100)
  ↓
Assign confidence based on data completeness
  
---

Sentiment Analysis:
  ↓
Aggregate news sentiment (weighted by recency)
  ↓
Analyze earnings call tone (FinLLM)
  ↓
Generate sentiment signal (-100 to +100)
  ↓
Assign confidence based on volume & relevance
  
---

Alternative Data:
  ↓
Analyze insider transactions (buys vs sells)
  ↓
Check options flow (if available)
  ↓
Generate alternative signal (-100 to +100)
  ↓
Assign confidence based on transaction size
```

**STEP 3: Signal Aggregation**
```
Apply category weights (Tech 40%, Fund 30%, Sent 20%, Alt 10%)
  ↓
Apply confidence scaling
  ↓
Apply time decay
  ↓
Resolve conflicts
  ↓
Calculate final signal (-100 to +100)
  ↓
Calculate overall confidence (0 to 1)
```

**STEP 4: Action Determination**
```
Final Signal → Action Mapping:
  ↓
+70 to +100 = STRONG BUY
+40 to +70 = BUY
+20 to +40 = WEAK BUY
-20 to +20 = HOLD
-40 to -20 = WEAK SELL
-70 to -40 = SELL
-100 to -70 = STRONG SELL
```

**STEP 5: Position Sizing**
```
Calculate position size:
  ↓
Base size (e.g., 5% of portfolio)
  ×
Signal strength multiplier (|signal|/100)
  ×
Confidence multiplier
  =
Final position size (capped at max, e.g., 10%)
```

**STEP 6: Output Generation**
```
Generate trade recommendation:
- Symbol
- Action (Buy/Sell/Hold)
- Confidence level
- Position size
- Entry price
- Stop loss
- Take profit targets
- Reasoning (FinLLM-generated)
```

## 🔑 Key Insights from Research

### Most Important Indicators (Ranked by Predictive Power)

**Technical (for timing)**:
1. **Multi-timeframe alignment** - When daily, weekly, monthly all agree (highest reliability)
2. **Volume-confirmed breakouts** - Price + Volume > Price alone
3. **RSI divergence** - Price makes new low but RSI doesn't (reversal signal)
4. **MACD crossovers** - Especially on weekly charts
5. **Moving average cascades** - Price > 20 > 50 > 200 SMA

**Fundamental (for direction)**:
1. **Free Cash Flow trend** - Growing FCF = strong signal (harder to fake than earnings)
2. **Revenue + Margin expansion** - Both growing = highest quality
3. **ROE > 15% sustained** - Indicates competitive advantage
4. **Debt/Equity decreasing** - Financial strengthening
5. **Earnings surprise consistency** - Reliable management

**Sentiment (for catalysts)**:
1. **Insider buying clusters** - Multiple executives buying = strongest signal
2. **Earnings call tone shift** - Confidence change from previous quarter
3. **Estimate revision momentum** - Consecutive upgrades > single upgrade
4. **News sentiment acceleration** - Improving trend > absolute level
5. **Unusual options activity** - Large informed bets

### Why These Matter Most

**Cash Flow > Earnings**:
- Companies can manipulate accrual accounting
- Cash is real and required for operations
- FCF funds growth, dividends, buybacks

**Timeframe Alignment**:
- Reduces false signals dramatically
- When all timeframes agree, signal reliability >70%
- Conflicts often mean "wait"

**Insider Buying**:
- Insiders have information advantage
- They risk their own capital (high conviction)
- Selling can be for many reasons, buying is typically bullish

**Sentiment Leading Price**:
- News and sentiment often precede price moves
- Market inefficiency in processing information
- First movers have edge

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Data Issues
❌ Using unadjusted data for backtesting (splits distort everything)  
✅ Always use adjusted data for historical analysis

❌ Not handling missing data (gaps in history)  
✅ Implement data quality checks and interpolation

❌ Mixing timeframes incorrectly  
✅ Align data timestamps properly

### Signal Generation
❌ Overfitting (100 indicators, all must agree)  
✅ Keep it simple, focus on highest value indicators

❌ Ignoring confidence (treating all signals equally)  
✅ Weight by confidence, recent data higher

❌ No conflict resolution (contradictory signals = crash)  
✅ Build systematic conflict handling

### Execution
❌ Position sizing ignores signal strength  
✅ Larger positions for higher confidence signals

❌ No stop losses (hoping bad trades recover)  
✅ Always set stop losses based on volatility

❌ Emotional override of system  
✅ Trust the system, log all decisions
